pkcs12-gpg-ssh-sign
===================

This package is intended for signing Windows binary files using a
GPG-encrypted PKCS#12 certificate and its respective GPG-encrypted
password, which is sent through SSH.  Two scripts are provided for
this task: pkcs12-gpg-ssh-sign and pkcs12-gpg-ssh-sign-send.

The rationale behind this tool is twofold:

1. Document a viable recipe for signing PE binaries using a PKCS#12
   certificate on Unix-like systems;

2. Improve security by avoiding storage and transmission of
   certificate-password pairs in the same media, and by adding another
   layer of encryption.

The passphrases for both certificate and password are independent and
SSH access is needed in the signing machine for the trusted
password-sending one.

The direct dependencies of this package are:

  - netcat;
  - GPG (https://gnupg.org/);
  - osslsigncode;
  - SSH (https://www.openssh.com/).

Hopefully no sensitive information is written to disk, passed as an
argument or in the environment.  Encrypted IPC is done using sockets
while the plain-text one is implemented using pipes.
